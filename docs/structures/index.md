# Handling structures

This section of the documentation is dedicated to guiding users through the process of importing structural data, specifically small molecules and proteins, into Biotite.
The ability to accurately and efficiently load these structures is foundational to conducting computational studies within the Biotite application.

## Objective

Our primary goal is to provide step-by-step instructions that ensure users can seamlessly transition their molecular structures into Biotiteâ€™s working environment.
This includes converting structures into the appropriate file formats, preparing the structures for analysis, and ensuring they are accurately represented within the software.

## Scope

**File Format Conversion** Detailed guidance on converting small molecule and protein structures into formats compatible with Biotite.

**Structure Preparation** Instructions on adding hydrogen atoms, assigning correct 3D atomic coordinates, and making necessary modifications to protein structures, such as flipping side chains when required.

**Importing Structures** Step-by-step process for importing the prepared structures into Biotite for further analysis.

## Importance

Proper preparation and loading of structural data are crucial for the accuracy of molecular docking simulations.
This section ensures that users are well-equipped to prepare their data correctly, thereby maximizing the efficacy of their drug discovery efforts using Biotite.

By following the guidelines provided in this section, users will be equipped to effectively use Biotite for their molecular docking studies, laying the groundwork for successful computational projects.
