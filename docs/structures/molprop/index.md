# Molecular properties

This documentation introduces the computation of critical molecular properties, such as logP, surface area, and molecular weight, which are pivotal in computer-aided drug design (CADD).
The software facilitates the rapid and accurate prediction of these properties, thereby aiding researchers and professionals in identifying, optimizing, and developing potential drug candidates.
