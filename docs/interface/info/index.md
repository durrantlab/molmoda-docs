### logP

The octanolâˆ’water partition coefficient (logP) for molecules is computed using the method described by [Wildman and Crippen](https://doi.org/10.1021/ci990307l).
The approach relies on classifying atoms within a molecule into one of 68 predefined atom types, each associated with a specific contribution to the molecule's logP value.
Atoms are classified based on their immediate chemical environment, considering factors such as the type of neighboring atoms, their aromaticity, and their bonding. This classification reduces ambiguity and ensures a consistent assignment of atom types across different molecules.

The logP of a molecule is calculated as the sum of the contributions of its constituent atoms, thus allowing for the estimation of a molecule's lipophilicity.
The logP value of a molecule is calculated using

\[ P_{\text{calc}} = \sum_{i} n_{i} a_{i} \]

where \(P_{\text{calc}}\) is the calculated logP value, \(n_{i}\) is the number of atoms of type \(i\) present in the molecule, and \(a_{i}\) is the contribution to logP for atom type \(i\).
